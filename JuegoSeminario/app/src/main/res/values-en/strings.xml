    <string name="info_ayuda">Welcome to Memory and Chance! Here´s a detailed explanation of how to play: \n\n
1) The objective of the game is to find all pairs of cards with the same value.\n
2) To start, select the `Play´ option in the main menu.\n
3) You will see a set of face-down cards on the screen.\n
4) Your goal is to flip them over and remember their positions.\n
5) Tap a card to reveal it.\n
6) Remember the value of the card to find its match.\n
7) Tap another card to reveal it.\n
8) If the value matches the previously flipped card, you have found a pair.\n
9) If the values don´t match, the cards will flip back over, and you must remember their positions for future attempts.\n
10) Continue flipping cards and searching for pairs until you have found them all.\n\n
Once you have found all the pairs, you have completed the game and will receive a score based on your performance.</string>
